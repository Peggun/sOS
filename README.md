# sOS (Shitty Operating System)

I have always wanted to learn all about operating systems. Something about them facinates me. So what better to learn about one, to code one from scratch, using two languages I have never used, and one that I know most about, NASM (assembly), C, and C# (maybe). This is the first time I have touched ASM and C and this will be a long journey, but I will test me so Im taking up the challenge.

I am using NASM via WSL on Ubuntu Latest for the assembly
I am using gcc as the C compiler
And using dotnet-8.0 for the C#

If you would like to join me in this journey, please feel free.

# Journey Updates!

Update 1: I managed to find a tutorial for a bootloader.asm that prints hello world to the screen, and it works!

Update 2: I have tried to add a kernel with a vga driver that I found which is going well (not). With some AI magic and hours wasted hopefully it should be fixed soon! I have found this website and I'm working around it https://dev.to/frosnerd/writing-my-own-boot-loader-3mld.

Update 3: After somewhat following that guide and rebuilding my bootloader, It's all going well! I really recommend that website because it tells you all about what the file does! Next, back to the VGA Driver!
